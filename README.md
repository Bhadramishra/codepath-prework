## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I only used the information given on the pre-work website to create the game.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Once I finshed the code, I wanted to play the game to make sure all of the code is working. Due to smaller error in spelling the game was not working. To debug my code, I went over the directions again and tried to look at my code step by step to see what I was missing. The first round I went over, I could not find anything. But than I tried again, this time testing each part of the code. This led me to a functtion in my script.js file. I had mixed up the name of function that was being called on a different function. I did not want to jumo to conclusion right away so I fixed that problem and continued checking rest of the code. Once I finished checking all of the different parts, I ran the code again and this time it worked without an error. This process really helped me understand the different functions better and allowed me to ask myself why I had included them. I use this same method for my codes in school as well, that helps me understand the concepts and different methods better. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After creating this one website, I am really interested to learn more about creating complex web designs. Add variety of features and creating updates for certain features. Also being a math major, I want learn more about analyzing certain features of a web design that garners more traffic to the website. Being able to study that will help in building a better web design to attract more viewership. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Unfortunately, I was sick for a very long time so I could not spend enough time working on the project. But if I had the opportunity to spend few more hours on it, I would add some of the optional features. Including, giving the player 3 strikes, a random secret pattern and a ticking clock. I would also want to go back and see if any code is repeated and try to minimize the repetitions by reusing code instead of rewriting them.
